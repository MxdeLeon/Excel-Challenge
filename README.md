# Excel-Challenge

The following is an analysis of the data available in the Module 1 Challenge file.

1.	Theater, film & video, and music categories have the highest number of initiated campaigns 
2.	The subcategory breakdown is:
  a.	All theater campaigns are classified as plays
  b.	Within music, Rock is the most popular subcategory
  c.	Within film & video, documentaries are the most popular
3.	Campaigns that started in Jul tended to have a higher success rate

There seems to be a limited sample size for campaigns in certain categories making it difficult to come to a strong conclusion of the success rate of those categories.

An examination of campaign popularity (campaign creation) vs year could show us trends in how campaign creation trends have changed over time. This could then be compared to backer count and average backer donation to determine popularity and how niche of a market the campaign might serve.
